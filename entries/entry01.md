# Entry 1

My topic for my freedom project is Autism and how to undertand people who have it. I grew up with a little brother who has a mild autism.My mom and i had a hard time getting to understand him because there were certain things that affecting him that normally wont affect us. Things such as lights and sounds sound or look much more different to them than it does to us. An example of this is if a firetruck was going past us, he would close his years bcause the sound is louder for him than it is for us. Another example is lighting in a room. If he goes to a concert with bright lights, his eyes wold be affected because they are very sensitive. Things such as planning of time and ticks also occur. People with autism show a great amount of anxiety. I want to inform more people about autism because of the amount of stares and bulling that occurs to people who are different. I want to give people more information of why and how people whith autism react to things and how to make them feel safe and secure. 
    In my next entry, i will talk about the scientific backround of the brain of a person who has autusm and how its different from the average persons.
